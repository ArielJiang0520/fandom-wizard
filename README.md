# Deep Learning Fandom Wizard

This project has the aim of bringing NLP and Deep Leaning to the Fandom community.

We want to understand everything fandom-related, especially the fanfictions!


## Feature: Fanfiction Digestion

1. Auto-classifying
  - is this fanfic romantic? PG-13? angst or fluff?
2. Writing styles analysis
  - Is the vocabulary rich? Would it be considered "well-written" in a common sense? What is the literature value?
3. Recommend similar content
  - Give us a good fanfic you read recently, we will recommend something that is similar to it. It could be of similar sentiment, style, fandom, or pairing
4. Compile music playlist
  - Give us a fanfic, we will compile a Spotify playlist

## What do we need from the community?

1. Provide us with more data!
2. Provide feedbacks!
3. Suggest more features!
