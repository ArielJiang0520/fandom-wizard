       "\"He makes himself watch the thin line across the other’s throat expand and break open, the rush of blood released on dirtied robes. It does not stain, just soaks into the fabric and becomes one with the mud-streaked red. The Wen disciple keels over, eyes rolling back to expose the glistening white. In his last moments, he cried. Before he touches the ground, Bichen has already found its next target, slicing through air, skin, and flesh as another man attacks from the left, arms raised high, mouth in a shocked circle as he is cut across the chest. His now exposed ribcage is sunken, every bone visible after weeks of rationed portions on the front. If he does not die from the blood loss, he will die from hunger or infection. No one will come in time to save him.It stinks. This war may be necessary and righteous, but it’s ugly, and it smells. The stench alone makes them wretch, ashes stinging in their lungs, open wounds, excrement and mud spilling, no boot left unsullied. Many have given up on washing their robes after a fight, many have been left with just one set of layers. Their cores have been weakened and their bodies strained. They hunger. Dozens have fallen not by their enemies' blades but by the resentment in the air, a thick taste on the tongue, clinging to them, beckoning them. It gathers at the center of the battle.Lan Wangji watches Wei Wuxian shape it to his will.Corpses bend and crack and realign, those with legs rise and run to throw themselves at the powerless Wen, those without limbs bite and snarl at anything that is close; he sees a body, not taller than his chest, throw itself at a man with its dented head first, choking him with its shattered pieces. A group of women, all bone and hair, smile brightly as they lift men thrice their weight and break their bones with dainty hands. When he goes to block an attack from two men to his left, Bichen hits nothing as they are pulled into the ground by rotting arms.There is no sense in begrudging them. There is no scarcity of enemies, and within the next seconds, Bichen flashes. Skeletal arms part for him before he rips a solider clothed in red from a kneeling Jiang cultivator, turning her so that she may face her final opponent. Her eyes flicker to his ribbon, then to the crown of his head as she spits. After he steps over her silenced body, he helps the Jiang cultivator to their feet, bearing most of their weight as they balance on their broken leg. Their cheeks are wet with tears. Swiftly, he escorts them to the tents behind the front and passes them to an awaiting nurse, surveys \\xa0the groaning disciples in different robes and degrees of pain. Some of them might never fully heal, despite the healers’ efforts.His own muscles ache. They have been pushing back this particular division of Wens for twelve days, barely making time for rest and nourishment. A light dizziness accompanies him now, and it’s fueled whenever Wei Wuxian appears in the edges of his vision. As he has made it his task to watch over his beloved, the strain to clear his mind has taken its toll. It is harder to stop his emotions from guiding his aim. \\xa0Anger boils in his blood, and it spits and splurges whenever Wei Wuxian is forced to put Chenqing to his lips, when the Wen storm at him with fear. Lan Wangji fantasizes about killing them all with his bare hands, feeling their pulse quicken and then stop beneath his fingers before they can come close to Wei Wuxian’s deathly song. Every drop Bichen spills is a drop on his tongue. He envies every fierce corpse \\xa0for its closeness to their enemies, wonders what its gnawing teeth feel when it tears apart joints or grinds bone to dust. It is why every swipe of his sword carries an apology.There is something appaling inside him. Something inelegant and ugly. Something that should have been shut behind a door and is breaking out now that the lock has been lovingly torn apart.A Wen disciple begs for his life, and he spares him, but in his relieved inhale, the man is torn apart by a corpse Wei Wuxian’s gaze meets his, over the battlefield, over the chaos, and a pretty little smile dances across his lips. His robes are clean, his hair shimmering in the setting sun. The red light dims his glowing eyes. Lan Wangji will not call him beautiful.He doesn’t look again for a while. Night falls, and they are winning, Bichen’s light giving the pained expressions of the disciples a divine edge. In the distance, Zidian’s crackle deafens the sound of blades clashing. It doesn’t mute the screams and the cries but it gives comfort in its unashamed hatred. Jiang Wanyin will be remembered victoriously.When the moon is high, the fighting has stopped and those who have yielded are escorted by the Jin. \\xa0Most of the cultivators are recovering, some in the mud right where they killed last, some by the tents, some in the arms of their companions. Others are tending to the wounded or lifting the dead. Sometimes a battle seems loudest after it has been won. The sobbing has a sharper tone, the rush of blood thunderous in their veins, boots squelching in the ground. The sound of the dizi has stopped, and the corpses are still, but Wei Wuxian never goes to rest right away. He stands silently as the hems of his robes brush the mess to his feet. Hands behind his back, Chenqing either in his fist or tucked away, he tilts his head and takes in his destruction.Lan Wangji crosses bodies to get to him, Bichen now sheathed.“Come,” he says.Wei Wuxian doesn’t let him lead the way toward the settlements. Within a moment, he is cheerful, twirls among the dead and kicks a bloodied rock, compliments the other cultivators and smiles at their distrust. “They put up a fight this time, huh, Lan Zhan? It means we’re getting close to defeating them. They won’t exploit our people much longer. What will you do once this is over, hm? Maybe you will finally come visit me at Lotus Pier, now that there’s no more scum defiling the view. You want me back in the Cloud Recesses, but I belong home with Jiejie and Jiang Cheng, they have been doing so much work without me!”He is interrupted in his next sentence when a Wen disciple breaks loose from a group of Jin, grabs a sword from one of them, and swings it down towards Wei Wuxian’s shoulder. Bichen reacts without his will, but he keeps it back impulsively, muscles moving on their own as time slows down for him. He sees Wei Wuxian’s hand stop the sword at the hilt. He sees the disciple’s clenched jaw. He feels it. The sharp edge of it digs into the tops of his thumb and forefinger where he curls them around the man’s throat. It takes no effort to lift him and squeeze. His own heartbeat aligns itself with the racing pulse of his victim.Lan Wangji knows what power means. It can take many shapes. In its purest form, it is this: the decision over someone else’s life. It is never an easy one, but often it is fast, he he kills quick and painless, dignified. This is not that, though. Air rushes under his palm, the man – adolescent, really, as most capable men have been sent first in the war and died many months ago – struggles, his eyes bulge, skin running purple, lips splitting.“You mustn’t, Hanguang-Jun,” Wei Wuxian voice rings through to him. “It wouldn’t become you.”Wei Wuxian’s shoulder is unscathed. Not a single cut can be seen on his robes, not even a bruise on the exposed skin of his wrists or neck. Only the space under his eyes is heavy and tinted and his lips dry from worry. His eyes, that are a pristine black in the darkness, his lips that are a deep red.Lan Wangji drops the soldier and takes a deep breath.Much more than the taste of the Wens, his mouth aches for the taste of Wei Wuxian.“You say I’ve changed, but look at you! Look at your hands! What will the cultivation world think, come here, give me those, Lan er-gege.” Wei Wuxian cradles his hands and uses his sleeve to wipe the dried blood and dirt from Lan Wangji’s palms before he can pull them away.“Stop it.” The Wen is crumpled to the floor, coughing violently. Suddenly, a little shape crawls from behind Wei Wuxian’s robe. A pale and delicate head, thin bones, quick movements of hunger. It’s the pale ghost child, red eyes glowing greedily as it descends onto the man.“Ah, forgive me, I forgot that you don’t like to be touched, but no that you have received your title, you especially can’t be seen this filthy!”He watches the child sink its sharp teeth into the swollen throat. Blood seeps into the ground. “I will wash up.”Wei Wuxian winks at him and continues walking, joy in his step, not a single glance back. “Oh, what a thought! Don’t let maidens hear of this! The strong Lan Wangji, tired after a fight and resting in his tent, all alone. They will tear each other apart for your used cloth, I know it!”He wonders how often Wei Wuxian allows himself the comfort of hot water lately. He is always clean, clothes neatly aligned even during the fight, but Lan Wangji has noticed the scarcity of his meals, the absence of visits to the nurses, the cautious line of his shoulders. If they were back in Gusu, if they were at an inn, anywhere but here, he would let servants draw up a bath and ensure Wei Wuxian could take it in solitude and safety. He would guard whatever room would need to be guarded, he would let no one near until Wei Wuxian had cleared his body and his mind. If he was wanted, if he was asked for, he would wash him, worship him, brush the hair from his nape to rinse the sweet expanse of his back. \\xa0He hums and breathes through the throbbing in his lower dantian.“Really, you should come to Yunmeng, it’s the best place in the world, Lan Zhan, I promise! There won’t be all this -,” he stops himself with a dry laugh. “But what am I saying. Now that you have earned your title, Hanguang-Jun, and I have my new methods, you won’t want to come visit me anymore.”Lan Wangji’s stomach twists, still hot but acidic now. “I will come.”He must. He couldn’t bear not knowing how Wei Wuxian was faring. The dizzying change from the cold smile at the work of his demonic arts to the bright spark in his eyes afterwards is as expected as it is alarming. He was always one to joke after a focused fight, but now something lingers in his gaze, something wicked and deceitful. There’s no smoke or accumulation of killing intent around him anymore, but amidst the bodies and the bones, Chenqing still draws all attention, its red tassel like a stream of blood. During the battle, the cultivators fighting alongside them had looked toward Wei Wuxian with conceited satisfaction, afraid of his ghosts but eager at their destruction of the Wen. Now their weary eyes follow him with close attention, and they hurry to get away, never turning their backs.Lan Wangji knows the Jiang disciples have only set up their tents near Wei Wuxian’s because they don’t want to insult their young sect leader. Jiang Wanyin is already waiting impatiently by their settlements, the purple lotus fluttering above his head. Fires crackle all around them, flames shadowed by groups of tired cultivators seeking reprieve after what they have done.Abruptly, Wei Wuxian turns to him, and for a brief moment, he looks at Lan Wangji’s hands. “I really can control it.”“Wei Ying…”“Do not take my matters into your hands, Hanguang-Jun. Why should you?” he asks lowly. “Now let us say goodnight. I need a drink! Do not be mad, Lan Zhan, let’s not fight.”As much as he would like to force Wei Wuxian into his tent, into his bed, his home, he must settle for giving Wei Wuxian into Jiang Wanyin’s insufficient care. His chest tightens as he watches Wei Wuxian sling an arm over his brother’s shoulders, poking a finger between his drawn brows, laughing at an insult. They wander off, disappear behind purple robes, and Lan Wangji is left in the chaos of the crowd. He ignores the hushed gossip and the gurgling of bottles draining to collect himself before he rushes to his tent.Nimbly set up earlier at sunrise, his it is small and sparse\\xa0. It shelters only the necessities, offering a semblance of solitude. He heats water as he takes care of Bichen and Wangji, strips down quickly and wipes his body with a cloth. The warmth relaxes his muscles and rids him of the invisible remains of the battle. He takes care of his body, nourishes it as much as the circumstances allow, and lets himself become aware of its strains. Afterward, he plays, eyes half-closed, not watching his fingers as they pluck at strings. Outside, the drunken laughter becomes quieter, and he knows that people are listening, hopes his music can give them relief and strengthen their cores.Unwillingly, he thinks about hot skin under his palms. Slick from blood and mud, the Wen disciple’s neck was slippery and yet decidedly solid in his grip. He could feel the ridges of his throat, the giving flesh under his jaws, the long fingers curling around his as Wei Wuxian cleaned his hands.He exhales and focuses on his core, on what makes him who he is, on what allows him to follow the righteous path. Despite the battle, it fills him, a steady flow between his dantian.Recently, sleep has been restless. Lights flicker behind his lids, his ears transforming natural sounds from outside the tent into distorted creaks in his dreams. His senses are alert, which is why he hears Wei Wuxian long before he slips inside, recognizes him by step and breathing pattern alone. Fabric rises and sinks, the moon’s light filters through his lashes for a heartbeat before it is kept out again. When he opens his eyes, he is met by Wei Wuxian’s stare. His face is shadowed, and there’s something too passive about it, something deep in thought. It might be his stillness, the unnatural rigidity to him as he stands in the corner and watches. It’s not right to see him holding back.Lan Wangji sits up on his bedroll and straightens his unbound hair. His two layers for sleeping are too thin for company, and he worries his chest is shaking with the beat of his heart. In spite of the darkness, he feels too seen, wishes it was a clouded night. But the stars are plentiful and the moon’s strong light penetrates the infinitesimal gaps in the fabric of the tent.“Lan Zhan…,” Wei Wuxian begins and tilts his head from left to right a few times before he continues. “Lan Zhan, you really are someone.”There is a small table in the middle of the space, and he gestures for Wei Wuxian to sit by it, accepting with both satisfaction and disappointment that he readily goes to his knees but on the far side, then inclines his head as Lan Wangji begins to prepare tea. He lifts the pot to boil water anew, but Wei Wuxian snaps his fingers, and a talisman burns, briefly flashing through the dark. Its flame licks between his fingers without hurting him. Neither of them speak until both their cups are filled.“Still bitter,” Wei Wuxian says, scowling. Then he laughs. “We might have changed, but a Lan’s taste never will. I wonder if your kitchens will ever enjoy the fragrance of spice.” Then his eyes widen, something real and raw. “Forgive me, Lan Zhan. Cloud Recesses must still be recovering.”In the months that Wei Wuxian was gone, Lan Wangji had wondered whether a home was still a home if its ruins had no people to come back to. He hums.“When we have defeated the Wen, we will both return to where we belong,” Wei Wuxian muses, swirls the tea in his cup. His lips part, the corner of his mouth twitches, but he does not speak what is on his mind. His teeth glint, edges sharp.“Wei Ying, the Cloud Recesses will welcome you–”Wei Wuxian smiles. “I beg you, don’t disturb this pleasant moment we’re having, Lan Zhan.”Lan Wangji lowers his gaze and carefully lifts his cup, gently placing it between his lips before treasuring the warmth of the tea. He wants to grab Wei Wuxian by the throat, feel him struggle for air, make him gasp. His skin would have to heat up, it would pulse beneath his palms, it would be marked afterward, no doubt of its maker. Everyone would know. Everyone would understand if he took him away and hid him, kept him close. They would be relieved by it. Anger spills inside of him.Outside, there is still commotion. It is never quiet on the battlefield, even if the swords have been sheathed. The toasts of victory are still excelled by the howls of pain, by the begging for forgiveness. They went to war and expected a comfortable bloodshed.“Would you have killed that man, Hanguang-Jun?” His head snaps up at the question. The curious glint is back in Wei Wuxian’s eyes, and he’s leaning forward, one elbow on the low table, hair spilling from his high ribbon. “You would have strangled him with your bare hands, so brutish, Lan Zhan. You say I have changed, but isn’t this method of killing entirely too appalling for the Lan? Aren’t you ashamed!”The tendons in his hands twinge. “Quiet.”“Oh, but how you shocked me, Lan Zhan! Did you fear I would kill him? What did you think would have been worse, hmm, Lan Zhan? How you would have loathed to see me use my tricks so up close.” He seems excited by it, a challenge in his searching gaze, his smile too sharp and too broad. His finger dances across Chenqing. “Would you have been afraid of me?”He rises with too much haste. The cups rattle on the table. “Wei Ying!”Wei Wuxian rises, too, and his hand glides through the air, toward his belt, and Lan Wangji, again, acts without thinking. His insides are burning, his ears are hot, his limbs trembling. His fingers find Wei Wuxian’s wrist just as Wei Wuxian clutches Chenqing. The air is too warm. “You hate it, don’t you? Is your hatred for a masterful tool like this truly just?”Lan Wangji does not react.“Don’t think I don’t see it. Others may not know how to read the composed Hanguang-Jun, but we have fought alongside each other in matters of life and death long ago, don’t deny it! You might not consider me your friend, but I have always cherished your company.” With a shocking realization, he sees wetness rise in Wei Wuxian’s eyes. “Will you lie to me, Lan er-gege, and say you don’t hate me?”“Shut up,” he gasps, shaking, leaning forward. His shin knocks against the table, and he steps around it, shoves Wei Wuxian further away from the bed without letting him go. He stops his other hand at Wei Wuxian’s collar, revealing the smooth skin below his collarbones, freshly washed and smelling like smoke.In the space between them, something builds. As it sizzles and warps, Wei Wuxian loosens the grip Lan Wangji has on his wrist, one finger after the other, then brings Lan Wangji’s palm up and faces it upward. “I’d rather see that hatred than fear.”He can’t help but make a sound, spread raw by his quivering lips. “Wei Ying…”“I am no monstrosity,” Wei Wuxian whispers, but it’s swallowed by a ragged inhale.Lan Wangji raises their joint hands to touch his cheek, tracing a fallen tear down to the curve of his chin, then upward again. Wei Wuxian’s lips are cold but devastatingly supple as he purses them, takes control of their movements, places kisses along Lan Wangji’s knuckles, to his fingertips, dragging his tongue over where he is trembling, letting it curl around his thumb, prod under his nail, sucks it into his hot mouth. Lan Wangji can’t stop staring at the shiny inner part of his bottom lip, presses down on it, feels his blood thrum with something akin to fury. He pushes his thumb further in, forces Wei Wuxian’s jaw to drop. “You do not scare me, Wei Ying.”Doubt glimmers in Wei Wuxian’s eyes, and before he can get lost in it, Lan Wangji kisses him. He doesn’t give him time to react, thumb hooked in his mouth until his tongue replaces it, keeping him close by his collar and the side of his head. His fingers rake between locks of hair, unbinding his ribbon, fisting into the strands. He is lost in doing, in moving, in taking. When Wei Wuxian twitches, he bites his bottom lip and tugs, shivers at the resounding cry. He tastes like tea, like a hint of wine. Like heat. Metallic like blood, and Lan Wangji’s own mouth fills with saliva. He pushes it into the hollow under Wei Wuxian’s tongue and down his throat, then licks at the curve of his upper lip, along his jaw, behind his ear where beads of sweat dissolve under his greed.Wei Wuxian pants, he’s already unravelling. “Lan Zhan, Hanguang-Jun, I didn’t think you were – you are – are you not disgusted –”“I cannot hold back, I apologize,” he stutters bites at the hammering pulse visible on Wei Wuxian’s pale neck. The skin bruises earily.“You, you shouldn’t, you –”He rests his cheek against Wei Wuxian’s, skims his hand down to his belt and begins to undo it, feels Chenqing slip. Slowly, he uses the leather to bind it and slip it into a pocket in Wei Wuxian’s zhaoshan, parting this, too. “Will you stop me?” He roams over the cloth underneath, feels flesh give in and ribs expand under his palm. He can feel Wei Wuxian take a deep breath, then swallow, then shake his head ever so slightly. “I am helpless, Hanguang-Jun.”Lan Wangji squeezes his eyes shut, wills them to dry, and then he opens Wei Wuxian’s remaining upper garments in one single tearing motion. He ignores Wei Wuxian’s squeak and looks, devours what he can: the blush blooming on his chest; the Wen brand, raised and ragged; other scars less patterned but frighteningly methodical; brown nipples constricting; the thin hairs around them, more hair thickening over his abdomen and surrounding his bellybutton; stomach concerningly sunken; sharp hipbones above the low waistband. His skin reddens as Lan Wangji scrapes his nail from his collarbones to his pectorals, down his solar plexus, along his sides.Wei Wuxian squirms, stutters. “I – I.. you can’t look at me like this, Lan Zhan, spare me, please, let’s just kiss!”“I will not,” he mutters, pushing the robes down onto the ground, cupping Wei Wuxian’s arms, muscles pronounced by hunger. His elbows are dry, but his underarms soft and malleable. There are scars here, too.“Will you stop squeezing me! It’s like you are testing if I am ready to be cooked, Lan Zhan – Lan Zhan, I’m not raw meat!”There is something reassuring about his protests, the promise of honesty behind his exaggerations that are almost as playful as when they were students. Lan Wangji is planning on making him beg for mercy in earnest. “Down,” he says firmly and steps back.This minimal distance between them is near painful, an ache that throbs in his teeth and fingertips, but he wants to see as Wei Wuxian glides to his knees and crawls onto the sleeping mat. His hips sway, buttocks well-defined behind cotton cloth. “Is this what Hanguang-Jun has been thinking about all this time? Making this demonic cultivator submit through the method of dual cultivation? Will you rub between my thighs, will you subdue me with your yang?”Lan Wangji’s blood surges in his groin. “I will take you.”Wei Wuxian’s laugh dies down as Lan Wangji kneels, wrangles him onto his back, and spreads his legs, he gasps softly as he lifts his rear to help get rid of his pants. “W-what, will you pretend I’m a maiden? Maybe you could use my hands, if I place them like this, would you like that?” He’s spreading his hands over his cock, fingers curving around it. Lan Wangji bites his tongue and tries to gain access, uncurling those fingers with force, aligns Wei Wuxian’s wrists and keeps them on his stomach. He is flushed, balls full and heavy, the tip of him glistening.“I, Lan Zhan, I don’t know if I can do this, oh no no no, don’t! Ah!” His torso roars up, twists when Lan Wangji caresses the hardening line of his cock, palm moving down a pulsating vein. Wei Wuxan’s face is pink, and his loosened hair whisps around his forehead; he has his eyes closed shut, brows deepened. “This is, this is too much, maybe we should stop, maybe we aren’t – like – that, let’s go back to fighting, you are too much –”“I have barely touched you, Wei Ying,” Lan Wangji points out, both regretful and amused. He is beginning to get dizzy with this power, overwhelmed by the possibilities, by the privilege of Wei Wuxian beneath him. Curious, he thumbs over Wei Wuxian’s slit, even more intrigued as a droplet wells under his touch. It tastes salty, ripe.“Did you just – that is not right, Lan Zhan, Hanguang-Jun – what are you doing!”He has bent to nose at Wei Wuxian’s cock, breathing in its heady scent, delighted by the fidgeting. The floundering hands under his grasp try to deny him his sight again, but it’s easy to press them down, as easy as it is to shoulder between Wei Wuxian’s legs and hold him open with an elbow to his inner thigh. “Be still.” His first lick just gets him a sharp inhale, so he tenses his tongue and dips it under the delicate skin crowning Wei Wuxian’s cock. He hears another shaky breath, then a soft whine as his lips evoke another noise, and slackening them, he drags them down to Wei Wuxian’s base, mouthing along the side. He wonders…“Do not move your hands,” he commands. After Wei Wuxian nods jerkily, he bends him in half, knees to his chest, thighs flexing.“This is too far, you can’t – you can’t look at me there!!”“Wei Ying is cute.”Wei Wuxian sputters. “Cute?? Hanguang-Jun, are you even human, you can’t be serious!!”“You told me you wouldn’t stop me,” he says, one last warning, and then he thumbs over Wei Wuxian’s hole. The gargled cry doesn’t ebb before he puts his mouth to the roundness of his cheek, sucking immediately. This is where sweat invites him to move, to follow the taste and the grain of the short hairs. His mind is focused, sharpening with Wei Wuxian’s whines and the trembling of his muscles. His teeth bury themselves into every surface he can get to, and soon he feels the dents they leave under his tongue.“Are you sure you can do this, Lan Zhan, your mouth –”He sounds close to tears again. Lan Wangji looks up to take in his pained expression, his glassy eyes. “How does it feel?” he asks, swirling his tongue around Wei Ying’s hole. This is what he had been yearning for, the taste of him, bitter and clean, as pure as a well of water.“It, it’s, I don’t know, I am not sure if I have ever heard of something like this!”“How else will you be wet enough for me?” To emphasize this\\xa0, he gathers saliva, releases it onto the silky underside of Wei Wuxian’s balls, and watches it slide onto his hole. He looks so tight, too tight.He almost misses Wei Wuxian’s weak gasp, too distracted by the give under his finger as he traces the spit. It sinks in as soon as he applies the slightest of pressure, like he is made to be taken, so pliant. It scares him, to an extent. How is he ever meant to stop? To let go and allow each other to part? What if he fucks him and will have to carry the knowledge of his warm inside in a future that denies him another touch? His vision blurs.At Wei Wuxian’s silence, however, he blinks back into awareness. His grey eyes are widened, swimming with confusion. His voice is shaky. “Y-y-you... wet enough for you… Hanguang-Jun, you can’t mean – you don’t mean to suggest...?”“I will fuck you.”Wei Wuxian seems shocked at the prospect, and the twisted thing inside Lan Wangji revels in it, smug at the crumbling of the aloofness from the last months, aroused by the writhing of the strong body pinned under him. He tries to slide in another digit but has to push Wei Wuxian’s legs higher to gain better access, then spits again. His tongue helps, and he gets more than its tip inside, using it to pry the soft muscles further apart, burying two fingers in wet heat.“L-lan Zhan.”“Mn.”“Lan Zhan, look at me, look at this feeble one, will you spare me? You have to be merciful, Lan Zhan!!” Wei Wuxian breaks off into a beautiful whimper, but then he giggles in amazement. “How do you know about all of this, hm? Did you read forbidden books, Lan er-gege?”“Quiet,” he warns and ensures it by straightening himself and leaning over to kiss Wei Wuxian with vigor, tugging with his teeth, stealing his moans, distracting him so that he can stretch him wide. He makes sure he can only move minimally, pulling away whenever Wei Wuxian sucks on his lips and taking in his desperate reactions: huffing and whining, torso twisting, legs reeling him in. His want is addictingly palpable.“Made for this,” Lan Zhan mutters, nonsensically. He imagines it, Wei Wuxian washing up and yearning for his touch as much as he longs for his. Sneaking across the camp and inside, just to get fucked and taken apart. “Wei Ying is beautiful.”“Don’t, please, don’t...”“You do not have a say in this,” he growls, underlining it with a harsh bite to Wei Wuxian’s chest. He sucks at the brandmark, at a broad scar at his side. Its texture is softer, tender, still healing. It’s almost the shape of a claw; something dug deep here and clung. Many of the scars are still pink, and Lan Wangji is overcome with anger, he will be the only one hurting Wei Wuxian from now on, he is his to hurt and his to care for. He adds a third finger, circles his fourth one, hole now loose enough for it to make sounds, muted puffs as air follows Lan Wangji’s thrusts. But something else, too, something that shouldn’t be as loud as it is, something that eases his movements. He stills, ignores Wei Wuxian’s confused whine. Looks down and freezes.It’s not merely his own saliva, it’s thick and tacky, spilling between his knuckles. It smells of Wei Wuxian. “You are wet.”Wei Wuxian lets out a single, breathless laugh, almost manic in its tone. “Do you like my gift to you, Hanguang-Jun?”Lan Wangji’s looks at him. Wei Wuxian’s expression is filled with mirth, he thinks he has the upper hand in this moment, and as much as Lan Wangji’s heart jumps at his joy, he wants to remind him that, if not outside, here he has power over him. Thus, he withdraws his fingers and begins to undress, folding and placing each article of clothing next to the bed. He watches Wei Wuxian’s face shift, brighten as he reveals more skin, greedy as he unties the knot at his pants. Then it pales. “L-lan Zhan…”He has kept his forehead ribbon for last, doesn’t dare yet to unbind it. Already, his blood becomes hotter, the trembling is back, the shapes of the tent blur, his lower dantian a force of heat, spiritual energy tingling at the edges of his body.Wei Wuxian reaches out with a slow hand and pouts when Lan Wangji catches it. “You… you won’t even let me touch that – that thing, before you will force it inside me? How will my body adjust, Lan Zhan, how will I be able to take this!!? You must be lying to me, is this really how cut-sleeves do it? How can you break one of your sacred rules just to ridicule me!!”In answer to that, he leans forward, raises his ass with one hand, and guides the tip of his cock to Wei Wuxian’s fluttering hole with the other. That first contact sets his skin on fire, and he weakens, grips Wei Wuxian’s inner thighs, and drives in, gasping at the tightness.There’s a quiet scream: “Hhhhaaah! Lan Zhan, Lan Zhan, it hurts, it hurts –”“Shut up,” he groans and finds it even harder to push forward, thickening with Wei Wuxian’s cries. “Wei Ying, quiet, or I will – I will –”Wei Wuxian is not quiet. His arms have come up to lock behind Lan Wangji’s neck, pulling him onto his damp chest. “So big, oh fuck, you are so big, Hanguang-Jun, this will tear me apart, I won’t be able to move –,” he mutters, falling silent for a moment to paw at Lan Wangji’s shoulders. Finally, Wei Wuxian whispers, “Is this your intent?”He tilts his head up, breaking his stare from the sight of their joined flesh to look at Wei Wuxian’s cock, the blush on his chest, then finally his dark eyes. His own hair curtains them, barely any light filtering through. He is halfway in now, balls drawn tight in anticipation, but he hums for Wei Wuxian to continue before he resumes pushing. The wetness sucks him in, and he can feel the pained throbbing around his length. It turns the thing inside him into a raging beast. Shame cages him.“Is this why you are doing this, Hanguang-Jun? To use me until I won’t be able to take part in the battle – oh, oh, please, mercy, I am a virgin, no one has ever touched me there, no one has ever touched me at all!”That shame dissipates in an instance. “Wei Ying.”“You –”“Take off my forehead ribbon.”They stare at each other. He might burst if he doesn’t move, if Wei Wuxian takes any longer licking his shiny lips and fingering the tie at the back of his head. “Are you… are you sure?”“Wei Ying.”It tightens, before it loosens. Then it glides down his forehead and over his chin, falls between them, on the scars littering Wei Wuxian’s body. He sees it like a slash of moonlight on supple skin. Then he fucks in harshly.Wei Wuxian wails.It spurs him on, mindlessly chasing the next cry, the next moan, drawing back quickly and pounding back in just as fast, making Wei Wuxian’s hole open up. More and more slick squelches around him, and it reminds him of the dewy give of Wei Wuxian’s mouth, so he sinks himself onto his lips, too, kisses him in between his whines. He bites and nips at the wound, licks at the blood, then nudges his tongue inside so that Wei Wuxian may taste himself. His left hand keeps squeezing flesh, thumb close to where his cock is shoving in, and his right hand cradles Wei Wuxian’s jaw, elbow on the ground to hold himself up and close. His stomach is getting moist with the leaking from Wei Wuxian’s cock and their sweat, and he wonders if he will smell like them for days to come, if everyone else will smell it on them, if they can hear him now, taking this feared boy’s virginity.He adjusts his posture, hoists Wei Wuxian’s knees over his shoulders, and shuffles impossibly closer, giddy at the difference in their position. “This suits Wei Ying,” he mutters. “Made to take me.”“I-I,” Wei Wuxian’s tries to say, but he is gasping so much that his words become unintelligible. “Do you – haahhhh, do you mean it, ah, what –, Lan Zhan!”He seems small, so tightly folded in half, completely subject to Lan Wangji’s strength and will, and yet he could escape with his mouth alone, his creatures just a sharp whistle away. They would come immediately, they have been wary of Lan Wangji from the beginning, their animosity heightened by their arguments. He wants to reach deep inside of Wei Wuxian and remind him of his core, of the rightful path, the bliss of it. His lower dantian burns, energy raging, and he lets it go, welcomes its force. He muffles his groan by biting at Wei Wuxian’s neck. “Going to fill you up, Wei Ying.”“W-wait, Lan Zhan, you need to stop, stop!” His hands flit over Lan Wangji’s back, to his sides, pushing him away. “You can’t, you can’t, you need to pull out, please, please. Lan Zhan, I beg you!”He lets him struggle and claw at him, embraces the promise of marks on himself, something to touch when he will be alone again. His spine tingles, all of him resonates with the racing of his heart and the hum of his qi, his cock twitching inside this warm sheath. It keeps swelling, rubbing up against Wei Wuxian’s wet walls, and suddenly he is no longer bound by the borders of his self. It’s exceedingly more intense than the equilibrium of meditation or sharing his spiritual energy to heal, it’s like his sense of reality is shifted, opened. Wei Wuxian must feel it, too, his whimpers have become constant, he’s crying, fat tears rolling down his jaw and neck and onto Lan Wangji’s tongue.It is the most beautiful thing Lan Wangji has ever experienced, and it is consumed, dissolved with a shock that turns his lungs solid, that makes him run cold, that makes it impossible to move. “Wei Ying,” he breathes, and he hears his voice break as if through a curtain of glass.Wei Wuxian is sobbing silently. His limbs are slack, palms motionless on the back of Lan Wangji’s neck. He is hiccupping softly, lashes clumped and reflecting the light of the moon, his face so, so wet. “You weren’t meant to find out, no one was meant to know, Lan Zhan…”He puts his hand on Wei Wuxian’s abdomen, below his fallen forehead ribbon, can feel his own cock through flesh, can feel the heat of his skin, but there’s nothing else, only a gaping void that wants. It is huge and mean, and it is beckoning Lan Wangji as much as it is rejecting him. It must hurt, it is hurting him even like this, and he can’t bear it, he cries. “Wei Ying…”“It’s alright, it’s all alright, Lan Zhan, you can pull out, you can let me go,” voice toneless, weak. His eyes are open now, bloodshot and dull, avoiding Lan Wangji’s. The space beneath them is grey in comparison to his white face, all his flush gone. Only his mouth is a red frenzy. Then there is a small, horrifying grin. “Monstrosity is not always visible, is it?”He has known for a while now that Wei Wuxian would be his only love. With every act, he considers the outcome not for himself but for Wei Wuxian, too. He loves him so deeply that the thing inside him, the impatient thing that had been shut away more than a decade ago, has awakened, and he is relieved by it. He wants to bring this man, this boy back to Gusu, he wants it so much, to shut him away inside the Cloud Recesses for him to keep, and it had scared him, enraged him, disgusted him by his own weak will. But here, now, hidden on a battlefield, the greed inside him has found its equal.“Shut up,” he spits. “You are mine.”He leans back onto his haunches and pulls Wei Wuxian with him, arms tight around his lifeless torso, bringing him up into his lap and further down onto his cock. He is still hard, still overflowing, and he exercises all his strength to fuck into Wei Wuxian. Nuzzling his cheek, he smears tears between them. “You are mine, Wei Ying. I will not let you leave.”There is something Wei Wuxian is trying to say, so he kisses him quiet, palms him where he has grown soft, his own knuckles bumping against the bulge of his length inside Wei Wuxian’s stomach. “I am going to take you every day, Wei Ying.”Wei Wuxian is shaking his head, but he is reluctantly starting to move up and down himself, sinking every time Lan Wangji grinds upward, bottom lip trembling as much as his thighs. “Don’t, don’t say such foolish things, Lan Zhan.”Lan Wangji rubs his thumb over Wei Wuxian’s cockhead, and it is thickening up again, gives a violent twitch when he digs the fingers of his other hand into Wei Wuxian’s waist and brings him down. He observes his forehead ribbon, tangled between them, the cloud pattern barely visible. In a trance, he wraps it around Wei Wuxian’s length, just tight enough to pull the supple skin.“Hahh, what are you doing, oh…” His cock jerks, weeping with his pleas. Their sounds pick up again, the slapping of their skin loud enough to fill the tent, and there is another surge of wetness, spilling over his legs. He lowers his mouth to Wei Wuxian’s collarbones, follows the sharp line of them, then licks over the scars on his chest. “You are not monstrous,” he says through the pain in his throat. “Wei Ying. Wei Ying.”There’s a whimper, then another one after he lets his teeth graze skin. “You are good, Wei Ying. You are so good.”“Stop, stop,” Wei Wuxian repeats, rutting against him, into his palm and back onto his cock. He’s warm again, pink spots appear on his front. The hair on his groin is brushed flat with sweat, his hot lips skidding over Lan Wangji’s face and finding his. Into their kiss, he mumbles, “I’m not, Lan Zhan, Lan Zhan, be kind.”The force of his spiritual energy is building up again, has never subsided, simmering in its wait. This time he is prepared for the greed, and he feeds it, fucking into Wei Wuxian without having to pull out, the angle perfect like this. His muscles, sore from days of fighting, are delighting in the strain and the effort of his thrusts. He is close, getting closer with the warm tears and spit on his tongue, with Wei Wuxian’s pained noises, with the mold of his pulsing hole. It is seizing up during every other heartbeat, squeezing him tight, like it's hungry for his release, too.“I have never hated you, Wei Ying.” It rips from somewhere deep in his chest, fragile on their lips, until he kisses it into Wei Wuxian’s mouth. He brings his palms up to his cheeks, tips him backward, onto the bedroll again. The pace of his hips turns frantic. “I could never hate Wei Ying.”Wei Wuxian writhes and twists, sobbing and begging for mercy. His cock is resting on the back of Lan Wangji’s hand, the white cloth a bright contrast to his flush. He feels it up, gropes the swell of his stomach, he can’t get enough of the shape of himself inside. He applies pressure, lunges forward, burying down, then he stops supporting himself on the dampened bedroll. His fingers act on their own, they land around Wei Wuxian’s warm neck. It is thrown back: the vulnerable underside of his jaw exposed, ridged throat pressed into Lan Wangji’s palm, quivering. He can hear his own heart in his ears and feels another echoing under his hands, around his cock, beckoning his qi. He is overbrimming with the sense of power.He squeezes. Wei Wuxian’s eyes flutter and roll back. Their breathing is loud, one deep and the other flaring, then sizzling out. They climax simultaneously.Lan Wangji keeps moving Wei Wuxian’s slack body, fucking into his slick hole, groping all over him, smearing Wei Wuxian’s own come into his scars, feeding it to him after he has allowed him to breathe again. Forces him to taste the evidence of his pleasure, pushes it into his willing mouth and kisses it right back out, swallows it greedily as he gives and gives. It doesn’t feel like his spiritual energy is leaving him, it feels like it’s flooding him, knows it must fill Wei Wuxian to the brim, hopes it soaks into him and stains.His teeth no longer ache. He has left their mark, is satisfied with dragging them over Wei Wuxian’s neck and shoulders, into the high bones of his cheeks without biting down. Salt. He has tasted so much salt tonight. His lips sting with it. He kisses Wei Wuxian’s wet lashes and the silken arch of his brows, and leaning back to take him in, he finds Wei Wuxian’s face blissed out, eyes half-lidded and shimmering, lips curved. He is somewhere that is not this tent, not the settlement, not the battlefield, it’s something unbound, something untouched. “Lan Zhan, I have never felt like this…you can’t stop, please…”“Wei Ying,” Lan Wangji whispers, and his cock pulses, spurts again. He can feel his come spilling out, tries to push it inside but only ends up angling deeper and making them both moan. His hips can’t stop moving, albeit slow and steadily. It’s too good to stop and too good to continue, it will tear him apart, this boundless pleasure. He’s caught in an in-between, unable to refrain from grinding inside Wei Wuxian’s used hole, unable to pull out and go back to the way before.“Touch me, Lan Zhan, please,” a melodious sigh. “Your touch…”He takes Wei Wuxian’s hands in his and presses them above his lower dantian. “I am here.”“Here…,” Wei Wuxian echoes, blinking heavily. “You are here.”The overwhelming hunger subsides, and he is starting to remember the outside again, the world behind the tent, the aftermath of the fight, their responsibilities. He will wash them both, will have to wash his forehead ribbon, will have to clean the remains of their deed, and at dawn, they will have to carry on, they will have to bring down the sun. He is looking at Wei Wuxian, his scarred and used body, his softened face hiding his drifting mind, and he knows. This war cannot go on the way it has. Lan Wangji will not allow it.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\""
